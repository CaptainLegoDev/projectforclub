            Hi i'm Finn. Some things I like is History,
            VR (super hyped for Alien Rogue Incursion), Game Development, and Physics.
            Lately I've been doing a lot of stem competitions, among other projects and nerdy stuff. Right now, I don't have anything really to show off, but I'll use this site as a staging ground for future things to add to my portfolio.

            I'm also gonna use to get some boba tea!
